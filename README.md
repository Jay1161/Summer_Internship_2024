## üåü Cybersecurity Internship 2024 - Project Showcase üåü

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Cybersecurity Internship 2024! This project showcases the work done during the internship, including practical insights and hands-on experience with various cybersecurity tools.

## Start of Internship

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Week 1

### *15th May 2024*

- *Orientation Meeting*: Introduction to Cybersecurity and overview of the internship tasks
- During the orientation meeting, I tackled questions regarding the basics of cybersecurity. The first week's agenda included understanding and implementing a Caesar Cipher tool.

### *Here is the Outline of Week-1:*

1. Learn about Caesar Cipher
2. Implement the Caesar Cipher in Python
3. Encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher
4. Decrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher
5. Test the tool with various inputs
6. Document the code and its usage

## üìù Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: Learning and Implementing Caesar Cipher

- Learned about the Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- Implemented the Caesar Cipher in Python to encrypt and decrypt messages.

### Day 2: Testing and Improving the Caesar Cipher Tool

- Tested the tool with various inputs to ensure it works correctly.
- Improved the tool based on test results and added more functionalities.

### Day 3: Writing Documentation

- Documented the code, explaining how to use the tool and its features.
- Created a user guide for the Caesar Cipher tool.

### Day 4: Final Review and Presentation Preparation

- Reviewed the entire week's work and made final adjustments.
- Prepared a presentation to showcase the Caesar Cipher tool.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Week 2

### *22th May 2024*

- *Online Session*: Introduction to Image Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
- This week focused on understanding and implementing image pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt images.
